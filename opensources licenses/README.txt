A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/Domany/pen/wBNNRx.

 Made that project for an educational websites, I used 3 kinds of
Animation in it, SMIL animation for the page flips, SnapSVG to animate the book opening and the amazing GSAP for the rest of animations :)
I hope you like my first SVG animation, definitely not the last.
